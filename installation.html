        <p class='card-text'>
          Java is required for use of this program and we recommend using
          OpenJDK 11 for current and future versions for best results.
          Starting with the 0.49.0 development release, it will be required.
        </p>
        <p>
          MegaMek should run on any computer that can run Java without much
          issue. Will NOT run on iOS/iPadOS/tvOS/Android devices. You
          experience will vary based on computer specificiations.

        Updating Between Versions
      </div>
      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='card-text'>
          When updating between versions, it is important to always use a
          new folder for the new version, make backups of all campaigns and
          custom files, and <strong><em>COPY</em></strong> campaigns and
          custom files to the new folder. Updating to a newer version is
          <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> backwards compatible and could
          break things.

        Stable vs. Development
      </div>
      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='card-text'>
          We recommend that most users download and use the stable version of
          the programs to minimize issues with bugs. The development versions
          are only for those users interested in testing and bug hunting new
          features.

        <p class='card-text'>
          To install the programs, unzip the download into the directory of
          your choice. To run the programs follow the platform specific
          instructions below.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Windows, do <strong>NOT</strong> use the built in utility for
          decompression zip files as it has been known to cause issues.
          We recommend using <a href='https://www.7-zip.org'>7-Zip</a>.

        Unix/Linux
      </div>
      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='card-text'>
          The Unix/Linux releases do not include application binaries, but
          you can run the programs directly from the included JAR files. On
          some desktops, you may just be able to double-click these JAR
          files in order to run the programs. you can also run the programs
          (MegaMek, in the example below) from the command line with the
          command:

        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>java <span class="nt">-jar</span> MegaMek.jar &amp;</code></pre>

        macOS
      </div>
      <div class='card-body'>
        <p class='card-text'>
          The Mac OSX installation now uses the same download as the
          Unix/Linux version. You just need to double-click the JAR file to
          run the program. You may have to also allow the opening of these
          files in your security preferences.
